Software of the Ideal Society to be Used in Non-Ideal Ones


Before speaking of what and how the software does, one should always speak of why the software is first of all required. This is even more true when speaking about the design and implementation of a Society in Software (SiS). And of course, the first sentence can have software replaced with anything else: it always hurts to ask the why and it is always worth it.


So far in human history (the last 200,000 years) the lifespan of a society was limited by the lifespan of it's rulers. For the first time in the last hundreds of years we had the opportunity to devise systems of rules (laws, written and enforced by a more or less elected group) which can govern more than the lifespan of one individual. One may find examples of laws even earlier, the Greeks, the Roman Empire, the Chinese Empire, and so forth, however as we cannot equate the mathematics done by Euclid (beautiful and correct as it is) with the mathematics done by a student of Euclid's 2,400 years later, we should also not consider on the same ground the laws written during the Roman Empire with the laws inscribed in a constitution of a country nowadays.

What we must ask now is this: if the lifespan of a society can be expanded beyond the lifespans of the individual rulers, can we devise a society to be able to rule and regulate itself thousands and tens of thousands of years.

The fact is this: the Earth has maybe 1 more billion years of a life supporting environment, however no human society that we envisioned and created so far is nowhere near to be able to sustain itself alive to reach the physical limit of the life supporting environment the Earth provides through astronomical luck.



## Who Has the Society?

Everyone must own the society in it's fullness. A society is such when it is one of owners. To the question "who watches the watchmen?" the only possible answer is everyone. Every owner of the society must write monitoring software. As today we have children in school learning to read and to add, in a society of owners the first course would be writing logging software, checking the status of the society. There should be no one unable to get "the pulse of the society".



## The Happiness of the Cannibal

Stated bluntly, the hapiness of the cannibal consists in the freedom for the cannibal to fullfil itâ€™s name: eating other people. And although humans have only one mouth, there is more than one way to eat another fellow human.

Any system caring for the happiness of the all must first of all concern with the happiness of the cannibal.

The gender of the cannibal is always it.
