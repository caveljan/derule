## Taxes as Investments

Instead of speaking of tax, corporate, individual, etc., to speak of Societal Investment. A type of investment which should be mandatory, but which could be controlled.



## Institutions

Societies so far have had institutions of control (legislative branch and so forth), that is institutions of punishment (police and so forth), of maintenance (hospitals, firemen and so forth), yet no society seems to have had institutions of reward.

An institution of reward will award a certain behavior with a certain amount of incentive. The incentive most naturally is money.

One issue could be the alignment of rewards-behaviors. One can easily imagine a society in which spying on your neighbors is rewarded. Maybe the issue lies in the attribution/distribution of power to elect the rewardable behaviors (this feels as a general, societal-wide issue).
